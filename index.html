        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I am Bansari, a passionate and experienced web developer and software engineer with over 5 years of experience in both front-end and back-end development. Throughout my career, my expertise spans working with technologies such as ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, Laravel, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL and PHP, while collaborating in Agile environments with cross-functional teams to meet client needs and deadlines.
          Through my recent completion of a MERN stack course, I have developed several projects that cover key functionalities and concepts of the MERN stack. While focusing primarily on the code and functionality to deepen my understanding, I have incorporated essential MERN features into these projects. These are still in progress, and I am excited to continue improving them.

            <p>
              I am a passionate and experienced web developer and software engineer with over five years of experience in both front-end and back-end development, with a primary focus on back-end technologies.</p> </br>
         <p> Through my recent completion of a MERN stack course, I applied that knowledge by developing a feature, which i have showcased in my portfolio. This feature is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) highlighting my newly acquired skills. These are still in progress, and I‚Äôm excited to continue improving them.</p>
